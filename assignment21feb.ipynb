    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow users to access and retrieve data in a structured format. \n",
    "      Using APIs is a more efficient and ethical way of extracting data, as it is typically permitted by the website owner.\n",

    "Regular Expressions: Regular expressions (regex) are used to match patterns in strings. While not as robust as other methods,\n",
    "                    regex can be helpful for simple web scraping tasks when extracting specific patterns from the raw HTML.\n",

    "Headless Browsers: Headless browsers like Puppeteer and Selenium can be used to render web pages and interact with JavaScript-heavy websites.\n",
    "                   This allows web scrapers to access data that may be dynamically generated or hidden behind JavaScript code.\n",
